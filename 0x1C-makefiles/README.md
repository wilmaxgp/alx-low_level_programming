# Introduction to Makefiles

This project introduces the concept of Makefiles and their usage in compiling programs. Makefiles are a powerful tool for automating the build process of software projects.

## Project Structure

The project directory contains several Makefiles, each addressing specific tasks related to Makefile usage. Here's an overview of the tasks covered:

1. **Task 0**: Introduction to Makefiles with a basic `all` rule.
2. **Task 1**: Introducing variables `CC` and `SRC` into Makefile.
3. **Task 2**: Adding variables `OBJ` and `NAME`, along with enhanced compilation rules.
4. **Task 3**: Implementing additional rules like `clean`, `oclean`, `fclean`, and `re`.
5. **Task 4**: Enhancing Makefile with compiler flags using the `CFLAGS` variable.
6. **Task 5**: Implementing a Python function `island_perimeter` to calculate the perimeter of an island.
7. **Task 6**: Advanced Makefile with additional constraints and optimizations.

## Usage

To use the Makefiles, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the project directory containing the desired Makefile.
2. Open a terminal window.
3. Use the `make -f <Makefile>` command to execute the Makefile tasks.

For example:
```
make -f 0-Makefile
```

## Requirements

- Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
